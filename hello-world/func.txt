For those who are watching this in 2022 and are unhappy that Vishwas is using classes instead of functions, you can code along using functions. make sure that instead of creating a constructor with this.state={someProperty: "someValue"}, you just create a useState hook like this: const [someProperty, setSomeProperty] = useState("someValue"). Make sure you import {useState} from 'react'. Also whenever Vishwas is using this.setState("anotherValue") to change this.state, you simply uset setSomeProperty("anotherValue") and the state/someProperty  changes. And last thing I want to mention is you don't need render (), just return.
